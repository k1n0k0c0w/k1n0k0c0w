go look at my [rentry](https://rentry.co/mooshroom)\
since im too lazy to make this look good

feel free to interact whenever but i am socially anxious\
& i probably won't initiate anything

cuddling, booping, hiding, covering, etc. all fine !!\
inspo is also fine but please don't copy my ponies ^_^

you can typically find me by the mcyt area ノ hermit hill but\
i do wander, and you can also find me at the market (?)\
or at the docks !
