since im too lazy to make this look good\
and i dunno what im doin on here\
‿     ‿     ‿     ‿     ‿     ‿     ‿     ‿     ‿     ‿

feel free to interact whenever but i am socially anxious\
& i probably won't initiate anything

cuddling, booping, hiding, covering, etc. all fine !!\
inspo is also fine but please don't copy my ponies ^_^

you can typically find me by the mcyt area ノ hermit hill but\
i do wander, and you can also find me at the market (?)\
or at the docks !

my current ponytown account is incredibly new\
but i also played before during 2021 or so
