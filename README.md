you can call me: kinoko, ray, sam, crayon, or yellow,\
or whatever pony im playing as currently.\
masc terms are preferred !!

feel free to interact whenever but i am socially  
anxious & probably won't initiate anything

cuddling, booping, kissing, hiding, covering, etc. all fine !!\
inspo is also fine but please don't copy my ponies ^_^

you can typically find me by the mcyt area ノ hermit hill but\
i do wander, and you can also find me at the market (?)\
area ... idk what its called. or at the docks !

my current ponytown account is incredibly new\
but i also played before during 2021 or so
